<p>This is a blended-coffee treat much like an iced cappuccino you might buy at a restaurant. You can make it non-dairy by using soy milk.</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>2/3 cup butter</li>
    <li>2 cups quick-cooking oats</li>
    <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>2/3 cup all purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/4 cup corn syrup</li>
    <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>

    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 2 cookie sheets with aluminum foil.</li>
    <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan. Remove from heat and mix in oats, sugar, flour, corn syrup, milk, vanilla, and salt until well combined. Drop by level teaspoonfuls 3 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets. Spread cookies out thin with a rubber spatula.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Cool on the cookie sheets.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, place chocolate chips in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted and smooth, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Peel foil from cookies. Spread melted chocolate on 1/2 of the cookies. Top with the remaining cookies.</li>
